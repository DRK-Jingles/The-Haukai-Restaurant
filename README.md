D)  Optimise page loading times: 2 seconds @ 2G network, others optimised as much as possible.

    Chrome Dev-tools has been updated and the preset throttling speeds have been removed.
    I have created a preset 2G network with the following stats: 450 kb/s download, 150 kb/s upload, 300ms RTT.
    This is based on the old 'Good 2G' preset with these exact values.
